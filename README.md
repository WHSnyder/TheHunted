 The player must find a key in a labrynthe filled with overpowered demons.  The player can only use their ears to avoid enemies.  
 
 This game features a beefed up audio system custom built for this labrynthe.  At start, a graph representation of the map is constructed.  Whenever (loosely speaking) a sound plays, its audio source object gets repositioned near the player to accurately mimic the path the sound would actually follow in a tunnel.  Given that our level does not feature significant change in elevation, we only needed the graph representation to create a convincing effect.<br><br>
